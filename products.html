          This project was done last semester for WEBD3201. We had to make a website 
          using a given template for our 'company'. The site a login functionality which
          also logged the login attempts etc. It was able to register two different types of
          users and was able to give access according to the user's authorization.

            This project was the first major project that I had ever done in my  life.
            This was done for NETD2202 as a final project. It was a little challenging due
            to some circumstances but I was able to make an acceptable program which I was happy with.

            I loved to work on this Assignment project
            because even If I was struggling through out the Project I was getting
            so much help from my Prof every time I asked and we made this project
            worked and I really enjoyed working with this project with the help of
            my Prof.<br /><br /><br /><br />

            In this specific Assignment as we started in the beginning of the term,
            I was struggling to create the GUI and I looked up help through watching 
            Lectures Videos and I started working on it on my own and found it very 
            interesting going forward and it possible with the help of my Professor
            as he was so helpful to me through out my whole semester. So, this
            project was one of my favorite.<br /><br /><br />
